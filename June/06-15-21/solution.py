    There are 4 ways of completing this problem (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-smallest-positive-number-missing-from-an-unsorted-array/):
        (1): Brute force - Iterating through to find all of the positive integers in the array, which at worst could take O(n^2)
        (2): Sorting - Quick Sort would allow for in-place sorting with a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(1)
        (3): Hash table or set - This would require building a new set of each found positive integer, would could result in a time complexity of O(n) but a space complexity of O(n)
        (4):
